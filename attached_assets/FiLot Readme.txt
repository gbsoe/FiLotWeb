## Smart Invest: AI-Powered Investment Advisor

The `/smart_invest` command and "ðŸ§  Smart Invest" button activate FiLot's advanced Reinforcement Learning-based investment advisor:

### Features

- **Adaptive Learning**: The system learns and improves recommendations based on historical performance
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Tailors recommendations to user's specific risk profile
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Analyzes APR, TVL, volume, volatility, and other key metrics
- **Confidence Ratings**: Provides AI confidence scores for each recommendation
- **Market Timing Insights**: Suggests optimal entry and exit points based on market conditions
- **Exit Recommendations**: Helps determine when to exit positions based on changing conditions

### How It Works

1. The system uses a DQN (Deep Q-Network) architecture with experience replay
2. Features are extracted from real-time pool data (APR, TVL, volatility, etc.)
3. Recommendations are weighted based on:
   - 50% technical factors (APR, TVL, volume)
   - 25% prediction scores from SolPool Insight API
   - 25% sentiment data from FilotSense API
4. Users provide feedback on investments, which trains the model further

Access Smart Invest through the `/smart_invest` command or by clicking "ðŸ§  Smart Invest" in the Investment Options menu.
